    Wants to spread their religion by force. Wants territory.






EMPIRE FACTION








A BINARY SYSTEM:
    SCIENTIFIC FACTION
        We need stuff.... we don't want to go get it because it's dangerous.
        We sell awesome sh*t
        Not aligned with the barons, but the barons sometimes buy gear from them
        The planets were ruined by scientific advancement - lets not do that anymore.

    SCAVENGERS FACTION
        "money through finds"

        Semi-Unified: Branches by barons -
            Three Branches - 
                A little Piraty and underhanded,

                    "get stuff make money (but not in a piraty way) and mostly honest"



    Science and research.
    A system of researchers using high-risk, high-reward scavengers to gather research materials from the shattered planets. All under the command of a few powerful barons trying to increase their wealth with SCIENCE!

        System:
            Binary star system.
                Close Gas Giant.
                Asteroid belt.

    WHAT DO THEY WANT:
            Deeply untrusting - when you enter their areas, they will attempt to make you sign some kind of deal with them.
