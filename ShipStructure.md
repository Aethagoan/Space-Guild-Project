<h1>Component Mechanics:</h1>
<h3>drops:</h3>
<p>Things are dropped in tiers with modifiers, but each item is unique, and degrades over time.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>tier 0</h3>
        <p>The tier everyone spawns with. Assume 1's as multipliers? ($0x)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>tier 1</h3>
        <p>Twice as good as tier 0 (2x). Easy to get ($1x).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>tier 2</h3>
        <p>Three times better than tier 0 (3x). Four times as expensive as tier 1 ($4x) Moderate grind (couple hours?)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>tier 3</h3>
        <p>Twice as good as tier 1 (4x). Very expensive ($8x)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>tier 4</h3>
        <p>Legendary tier (6x). Expense ($20x)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>tier 5</h3>
        <p>Things you cannot buy, that you find by fighting large enemies (major faction enemies). (8x)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>tier 6</h3>
        <p>(10x) Endbosses.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Repair mechanics<h3>
<p>Components have health! Plus they degrade over uses. Components don't break, you don't lose them at zero health, but they cease to function. Modifiers will never go back to the max, but can be repaired to a point. (there should be a limit at the next teir down once they've downgraded that much, always repairable to there.)</p>
